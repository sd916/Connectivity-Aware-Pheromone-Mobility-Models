To run Base-Station-Connectivity-Aware Pheromone Mobility Model (BS-CAP) simulation (Heuristic Model only), 
	python3 main_connect.py {Number of UAVs} {UAV speed m/s} {Tx range} {Map size} {beta for tuning parameter}

Input argument settings:
	Number of UAVs = 50 , 100
	UAV speed = 20 , 50 (m/s) 
	Tx range = 1200 (m)
	Map size = 8000 (m)    (for 8km x 8km map area)
	beta = 1.5  (β ∈ {0.5, 1.5, 2.5})     
	(1.5 - mid connectivity and coverage performance; 0.5 - low neighbor connectivity, high coverage; 2.5 - high neighbor connectivity, low coverage; Additional 		UAVs always try to abide by base station connectivity constraint)

Other parameters can be set in main_connect.py, such as,
	num_episodes = 20 # no. of runs for averaging
	nBaseStations = 1 # Single base station node at the mid-bottom of the map.
    	simTime = 2005 # seconds 
	position_log_interval  = 205 # seconds; 
	(starts to log positions at (simTime - position_log_interval); Hence, we log the last position_log_interval seconds of node positions saved in nodeTrajectories folder)

	
Outputs:
	Connectivity (NCC, ANC, BS_connectivity) and Coverage (Coverage time, Fairness) performance metrics stored in ./BSCAP_results_20runs/
	Node Trajectories are saved in ./nodeTrajectories/BSCAP/
	Format: In Run 0 using CAP mobility for Node 0 is saved as '0BSCAP_Node0.txt' -> At time t, UAV Postion_X, UAV Postion_y, UAV Next-waypoint_X, UAV Next-waypoint_Y

		Node Trajectories for 50,100 UAVs at 20, 50 m/s, using Tx range = 1200m, Map size = 8000m x 8000m and beta = 1.5 can be found in

Note: If the 'Number of UAVs' used in the simulation is set to 50, then there will be node trajectories (of nodes named Node0 to Node50) saved; ( 50 UAVs + 1 BS node).
