To run Connectivity-Aware Pheromone Mobility Model (CAP) simulation, 
	python3 main_connect.py {Number of UAVs} {UAV speed m/s} {Tx range} {Map size} {beta for tuning parameter}

Input argument settings:
	Number of UAVs = 50 , 100
	UAV speed = 20 , 50 (m/s) 
	Tx range = 1200 (m)
	Map size = 8000 (m)    (for 8km x 8km map area)
	beta (β) = 0.5, 2, 3, 4;     
	(β=0.5 gives low network connectivity, fast coverage performance, while β=4 gives high network connectivity, slower coverage performance)

Other parameters can be set in main_connect.py such as,
	simTime = 2005 # seconds 
	position_log_interval  = 205 # seconds; 
	(starts to log positions at (simTime - position_log_interval); Hence we log the last position_log_interval seconds of node positions save in nodeTrajectories folder)
	
	
Outputs:
	Connectivity (NCC,ANC) and Coverage (Coverage time, Fairness) performance metrics stored in ./CAP_results_20runs/
	Node Trajectories are saved in ./nodeTrajectories/
	(Format: In Run 0 using CAP mobility for Node 0 is saved as '0CAP_Node0.txt' -> At time t, UAV Postion_X, UAV Postion_y, UAV Next-waypoint_X, UAV Next-waypoint_Y

	Node Trajectories for 50,100 UAVs at 20,40 m/s, using Tx range = 1200m, Map size = 8000m x 8000m and beta = 3.0 can be found in
